THIS IS THE SUBMISSION FOR THE CHALLENGE ~PATTERN HUNT~

NEXT TWO TERMS:
#30 #42

PATTERN EXPLANATION:
The difference between each numbers of the pattern is given by (2*N) #where N is natural numbers
for example:
from 0 to 2, difference=2 [2*1=2]
from 2 to 6, difference=4 [2*2=4]
from 6 to 12, difference=6 [2*3=6]
from 12 to 20, difference=8 [2*4=8]
from 20 to 30, difference=10 [2*5=10]
from 30 to 42, difference=12 [2*6=12]
